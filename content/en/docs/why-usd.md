UDS creates, supports, and maintains a secure runtime platform that simplifies software delivery and deployment for both application development
teams and platform teams. UDS deploys mission applications into any environment while providing documentation and evidence to facilitate obtaining an Authority to Operate (ATO). By leveraging the power of open source projects like Zarf, Pepr, Lula, LeapfrogAI and more, UDS enables the creation of
portable and compliant
software artifacts.

With UDS, mission teams can:

- Deploy a new accreditable software environment swiftly and seamlessly.
- Update mission application bundles and packages on-demand in minutes.
- Deploy mission applications to classified and unclassified cloud, on-premises, and edge environments.
- Use open and extensible architectures.
- Avoid data and vendor lock-in.

## Why Use UDS?

### Enhanced Portability and Cross-Platform Support

UDS offers enhanced portability, allowing teams to deploy
their software artifacts across diverse environments regardless of underlying infrastructure. Whether it's cloud-based,
on-premises, or edge environments,
UDS ensures that mission applications can be easily migrated and executed on different platforms. This seamless deployment
across domains reduces the need for platform-specific modifications, accelerating the ATO process through the incorporation
of compliance documentation directly into the software delivery pipeline. UDS's portability
enables Mission Heroes to adapt quickly to changing infrastructure needs and expand their reach to various environments.

### Open Source and Avoiding Vendor Lock

UDS is built on a foundation of open-source technologies, providing Mission
Heroes with the freedom to access and modify the underlying code. By leveraging open-source projects like Zarf, Pepr,
Keycloak, Istio, and more, UDS ensures that users can avoid vendor lock-in and maintain control over their data. This open approach allows Mission Heroes to customize and optimize their software delivery processes.

### Security and Compliance

UDS places a strong emphasis on security and compliance, enabling Mission Heroes
to meet stringent requirements for obtaining an Authority to Operate (ATO). It implements the Open Security Controls
Assessment Language (OSCAL) framework, which binds compliance to specific software features, ensuring that controls
required for accreditation are met efficiently. By integrating security and compliance into the software development
and deployment lifecycle, UDS helps your team proactively address potential vulnerabilities, reduce risk,
and maintain a secure software ecosystem.

### Leverage UDS Core

UDS Core offers a foundational suite of applications designed to establish a secure and efficient mission environment. It encompasses critical functionalities such as collaboration, monitoring, logging, security, compliance, and data protection. By utilizing these integrated applications, Mission Heroes can confidently deploy and operate source packages that adhere to rigorous security and performance standards.
